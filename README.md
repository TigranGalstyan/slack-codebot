# slack-codebot
Slack bot for checking Python codes (for educational purposes)

This simple bot takes python functions as direct messages or slack code snippets. Then it evaluates users code and the correct code given in utils.py on the inputs given in inputs.json. Then it compares outputs, generates the result and sends it to the user ( for example "Your code was correct" or "Your result is A but the correct result is B for the inputs I ... " etc. ).
